      Intel System Stacks are a set of production ready containerized reference
      architectures with integrated, highly-performant, open source components
      optimized for 2nd generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors.
      Highly-tuned and built for cloud native environments, the solution
      enables developers to quickly prototype by reducing complexity
      associated with integrating multiple software components, while still
      giving users the flexibility to customize their solutions.
